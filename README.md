## My process

This is my first time working on a Mobile first work flow.
Started building the design for mobile and used BEM notation for class names.
Implemented Sass preprocessor which while combining with BEM notation worked well. There was need to write the entire class name and nesting selectors is a thing, utilized variables and mixins. Once done with mobile design, added some classes for desktop design and checked on accessibility, Validated HTML and CSS using W3C Validator.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM Methodology
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned using BEM methodology.
Learned and implemented Sass - variables, mixins.
Working with Mobile first workflow is better for faster development.

### Continued development

I like this workflow of combind BEM with Sass and using Mobile First Workflow. Will focus more on the flow and build some more projects
